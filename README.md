# UGM-FIND-IT-2021
On Jun 2021, my team (https://www.linkedin.com/in/msammyivank/ and https://www.linkedin.com/in/imavv/) once again embarked on a data science competition, which is Data Analytics Competition FIND IT! 2021. In this competition we were challenge by a unique machine learning case, we were given a training dataset but with only around 10-20% of labeled data. The dataset was about book price so it was a regression problem. To solve it we decided to make 2 models, first the model to predict all unlabeled data in train set from 10-20% labeled data, and second the model to predict test set from a complete labeled train set. We used several models such as CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, AdaBoost and then ensembling those models by soft voting method. We also did hyperparameter tuning for both models to improve the models performances. In the end, we achieved RMSE score around 160.000.

At the final round, we were to present our methodology to solve this semi-supervised regression problem. Our team not only presented the methodology but the background, business implications, and future research for this book price prediction model. Thus, we placed 1st in this Data Analytics Competition FIND IT! 2021.
